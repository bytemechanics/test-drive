Pure java spock framework implementation

## Motivation
Spock framework is fantastic but use groovy to test java always will be become a mess. After executing a test that should fail and does not fail. Decided that this must be done in pure java.

## Quick start

1. First of all include the Jar file in your compile and execution classpath.

   **Maven**
   ```xml
   <dependency>
	   <groupId>org.bytemechanics</groupId>
	   <artifactId>jspock</artifactId>
	   <version>X.X.X</version>
   </dependency>
   ```
   **Graddle**
   ```groovy
   dependencies {
      compile 'org.bytemechanics:copy-commons:X.X.X'
   }
   ```

2. Use the library you prefer, to main reference please download and look in javadoc, we intend to keep it updated and explicative
